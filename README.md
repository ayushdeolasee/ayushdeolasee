# 👋 Hey there, I'm [Ayush]!

## 🚀 Student | Geek | Coder

I'm a student with a passion for all things tech, especially diving deep into the fascinating world of Machine Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and software magic ✨.

### 💻 What I'm Excited About:

- 🤖 Machine Learning: Making computers smarter, one model at a time.

- 📚 Large Language Models (LLMs): From GPT-2 style transformers to custom language solutions, I love playing around with words—and code!

- 🌐 Tech Innovation: Always curious, always building, always learning.

### 🔧 Cool Stuff I've Built:

- 🤖 GPT-2 Style Transformer: My very own transformer-based language model, exploring the depths of NLP.

- 📁 File Search Application: A lightning-fast app to find files quicker than you can say "Where did I put that...?"

- 📦 Fastn Language Packages: Contributing handy tools and making the fastn ecosystem even faster.
